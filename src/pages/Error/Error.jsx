      <ol>
        <li>
          Double-check the URL: Just like reviewing lines of code, a tiny typo
          can lead you astray. Ensure the URL is accurately spelled.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rebase your navigation skills: Similar to syncing branches in Git,
          take a moment to reassess your navigation. Utilize the navigation bar
          above to explore other corners of this developer's universe.
        </li>
        <li>
          Git pull your patience: Just like waiting for a Git pull command to
          complete, sometimes finding what you seek requires a little patience.
          Take a deep breath and give it another try.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </>
